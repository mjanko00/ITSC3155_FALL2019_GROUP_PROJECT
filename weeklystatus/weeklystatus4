For the upcoming week, the team would like to expand the site’s functionality to include all CRUD elements. 
Eventually, the team will need to develop a backend to store the information that our user will enter, like calories, proteins, fats, and carbs.

Kelly zipped the project for Sprint 2 Part 1 deliverable and submitted the assignment. 
Nathaniel finalized the UML diagrams for Sprint 2 Part 2. 
The UMLs will require consistent updating as the project develops. 
As for code deployment, Tyler’s branch functions with all CRUD elements. 
Each function, Create, Read, Update, and Delete, works properly. 
Currently, Fay’s branch allows strings to be input for all database fields (serving size, calories, fats, proteins, carbs). 
Together, Tyler’s branch and Fay’s branch have the individual pieces needed for the Sprint 3 deliverable.

This week, we should update our master branch so that all changes are in the centralized location. 
We were successful during Sprint 2 and want to maintain momentum. 
With all base functionalities complete, the group can focus on data validation for user input, or aesthetic elements in HTML that produce a more professional site. 
There may be other goals that arise during our meetings.

As a team, there are no significant issues currently impacting our code development. 
Eventually, the team would like to implement more polished site functionalities that enhance the user experience. 
The team would appreciate a brainstorming session with the TA where we can discuss unique or complex site features that users typically enjoy.
