During this week, our team will complete the base functionalities outlined in our storyboard prototype. 
We did not discuss responsibility, but importing code from our current blog sites should not be time consuming nor should it be difficult. 
As we import the blog base code, we will better see what blog site functions work well in our food journal, and what functions need editing. 
The group is focused on delivering a product first and foremost. Product refinement will take place over subsequent weeks.

In the past week, we created the blog app called “foodjournal.” 
The latest commits from Tyler and Fay explain that our site has a create and show method for the journal controller.
Kelly created the skeleton for our site’s stylesheets. 
Nathaniel began a draft of the UML diagram for the site.

For the upcoming week, the team would like to expand the site’s functionality to include all CRUD elements. 
Eventually, the team will need to develop a backend to store the information that our user will enter, like calories, proteins, fats, and carbs.

When our group meets with the TA, we will want to discuss the Git branches, Git merges, and better understand the Git push/pull process. 
To understand these features in Git will allow our team to follow daily/weekly routines to progress with the project.
