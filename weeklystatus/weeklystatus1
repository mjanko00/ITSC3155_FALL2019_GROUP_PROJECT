The purpose of this document is to chart the progress of the ITSC3155 group project and to provide weekly status to TAs and Dr. Najjar. 
This is the teamâ€™s first status report, so we are unable to state our previous goals for the project.

As a group, this week we decided to firmly pursue our food blog/journal idea. 
This project has the potential for many different functionalities, however, we are hesitant to narrow our focus at this early stage. 
Instead, we created a broad framework in which we will build basic functionalities, like creating posts. 
Later, we plan to expand upon these basic functions, but do not want to pigeonhole ourselves at the beginning.

The only goals discussed during the first week was team status responsibilities. 
Nathaniel will write every weekly status, then publish the status on Sunday to each teammate. 

To distribute the report on a Sunday will allow for clarifications and proofreading before final submission on Monday.

The team was not necessarily aware of expectations to set meeting times with TAs. We will discuss availability during our class sessions.
