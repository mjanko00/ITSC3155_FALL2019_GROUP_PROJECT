The only goals discussed during the first week was team status responsibilities. 
Nathaniel will write every weekly status, then publish the status on Sunday to each teammate. 

Now in our second week of the group project, we were expected to create a storyboard that roughly outlines site functionality. 
We were able to complete the storyboard in our classroom session, which is important, because coding for the project can happen on an individual basis, but general site functionality, look, and feel, should be discussed with all team members present. 
Kelly took responsibility to turn in the storyboard assignment.

During this week, our team will complete the base functionalities outlined in our storyboard prototype. 
We did not discuss responsibility, but importing code from our current blog sites should not be time consuming nor should it be difficult. 
As we import the blog base code, we will better see what blog site functions work well in our food journal, and what functions need editing. 
The group is focused on delivering a product first and foremost. Product refinement will take place over subsequent weeks.

When our group meets with the TA, we will want to discuss the code import process, as well as more complicated functionalities that we can use in later iterations of the food journal.
