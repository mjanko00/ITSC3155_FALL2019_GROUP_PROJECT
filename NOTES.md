Hello and welcome to team No Gleen!'s team project.

This file will be updated with great information as we
develop our project for the rest of the semester.

Feel free to add any notes in this file by including your name, role,
and a short explanation as to what the note pertains to.

Kelly McLaughlin - I edited the index view so that our table actually 
pulls from our database. Since the database only has fields for "title" and
"text", we still need to edit the schema so that our fields are as follows:

Food name
Meal type
Serving Size
Calories
Protein
Carbs
Fat

Once those are in there I can redo the table in the index view and change our
"new" view so it matches
